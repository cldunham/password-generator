Project - Password Generator

Goal: create a strong randomly generated password for use with sensitive data

Criteria:
* present user with a password generator button
* once clicked, present a series of prompts for password criteria
* user selects which criteria to use in the password
    - when promted for length, a length is chosen between 8-128 characters
    - when asked for character types, user confirms whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
    - at least one of the character types must be selected
    - once all prompts are answered, a password is generated matching the selected criteria
    - the password is then dispayed on screen

The images below include a screenshot of the website, the password length prompt, an alert for length error, a prompt, and an image of a randomly generated password.

I learned how to apply variables, functions, arrays, click buttons, and more.
